# Imatinib-DDI-Model
Modeling of published clinical imatinib studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model for imatinib and its metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib. The model was developed using published clinical studies and its predictive performance was evaluated within our DDI network. The file "Imatinib-Model" contains simulations of the published clinical studies used during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation, please refer to [1]. Furthermore, the DDI files contain simulations of published clinical DDI studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the imatinib model regarding DDIs with the perpetrator drugs rifampicin, ketoconazole, gemfibrozil and ritonavir as well as the victim drugs simvastatin and metoprolol, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied rifampicin, ketoconazole, gemfibrozil, ritonavir, simvastatin and metoprolol models have been published previously [2-7].
